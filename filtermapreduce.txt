filter(): filters the ele of array.

If call-back function returns TRUTHY, then that value will be stored in new resultant array or else it willn't be stored.


map(): creates a new resultant array.

Takes 1 from original array ele at a time and passes it to predicate or call-back function.

The value returned by call-back function will be added into the new resultant array.


reduce(): 

The reduce() method runs a function on each array element to produce (reduce it to) a single value.

The reduce() method works from left-to-right in the array. See also reduceRight().

The reduce() method does not reduce the original array.
